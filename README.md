# helm-devpi
A Helm chart for devpi - accelerating python deployments on Kubernetes

This is an early version of a Helm chart for K8s deployments. 
It's functional, yet I still need to add password secrets, and check that caching is working across helm re-releases.

The principle dependency is my [docker-devpi](https://github.com/topiaruss/docker-devpi) image.
